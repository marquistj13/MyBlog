## Meta
以下改编自博文： [In Mathematics, ‘You Cannot Be Lied To’](https://www.quantamagazine.org/sylvia-serfaty-on-mathematical-truth-and-frustration-20170221)

主要内容是采访一个女数学家。但道理都是可以泛化的。

首先是文章的总结：
>For Serfaty, mathematics is about building scientific and human connections.

## 科学家不必是天才
或许5 percent的东西需要天才去做，但95 percent doesn’t。
You don’t have to be among the 5 percent to do interesting math.

## be comfortable with frustration
That’s research. You enjoy solving a problem if you have difficulty solving it. The fun is in the struggle with a problem that resists. 

You have to be able to accept frustration, failure, your own limitations. 

But if you have enough ability, then you cultivate it and build on it, just as a musician plays scales and practices to get to a top level.

## 如何tackle a problem
research 并不只是 about these big ideas。
you really have to start from simple, stupid computations — start again like a student and redo everything yourself. 

## Do you cultivate that perspective, or does it come naturally?
要告诉自己，肯定有bright people想过这些问题了，咱们是比不过他们的。
>But let me try to rethink the problem almost from scratch with my own little basic understanding and knowledge and see where I go. Of course, I have built enough experience and intuition that I sort of pretend to be naive.

即，要从头开始rethink the problem，建立自己的直觉。
这些intuition得假装是naive的（要闷声发大财？）
